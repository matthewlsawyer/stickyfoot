Sticky footer using display table
----------

This project is just a proof of concept for using the ```table``` rendering block to acheive the sticky footer. The benefit of doing it this way over [Ryan Fait's way](http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/ "Ryan Fait's css sticky footer") is that your content div grows to the full size of the page, rather than dealing with a ```push``` element at the end of your content.
